# Slime-Basic-Enemy-Behavior
--------------------------------------------------------
Basic programming in C++ of the behavior of a Slime as an enemy and the main movement actions of the main player.
--------------------------------------------------------

Project made in UnrealEngine about the behavior of a Slime as an enemy, having the possibility of patrolling and moving randomly, as well as chasing the player when he is in range of vision.

Starting from a completely empty project everything was done in C++, programming the artificial intelligence of the character and its behavior in the two different modes: chasing and patrolling.

Also in the main player the basic walking, jumping and running movement of a third person character was programmed in C++, as well as its own animations.

In the level when you open the project you will find a scene with different obstacles and several Slimes around, each of these Slimes can move either by waypoint or randomly, to configure each one you can change the option in each of the actors. As for the main player, you can change the walking speed and the running speed, also taking into account the blendspace created for the animations.

In this project you will find useful things like the basic programming of an enemy completely made in C++ and the interaction that it would have with the main player, besides different models and animations made in blender.
