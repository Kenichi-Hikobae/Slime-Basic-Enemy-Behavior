# Slime-Basic-Enemy-Behavior
--------------------------------------------------------
Basic programming in C++ of the behavior of a Slime as an enemy and the main movement actions of the main player.
--------------------------------------------------------

Project made in UnrealEngine about the behavior of a Slime as an enemy, having the possibility of patrolling and moving randomly, as well as chasing the player when he is in range of vision.

Starting from a completely empty project everything was done in C++, programming the artificial intelligence of the character and its behavior in the two different modes: chasing and patrolling.

Also in the main player the basic walking, jumping and running movement of a third person character was programmed in C++, as well as its own animations.

In this project you will find useful things like the basic programming of an enemy completely made in C++ and the interaction that it would have with the main player, besides different models and animations made in blender.
